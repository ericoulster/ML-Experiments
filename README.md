# ML-Experiments
A repository containing sample/practice Machine Learning models completed outside of work.

While all of the work shown off in here is complete, some of it is more proof-of-concept work than an optimized model.

Regardless, it should illustrate technical competance with a variety of Machine Learning libraries, as well as a general understanding of ML modeling.
