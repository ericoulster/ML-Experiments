Of the projects in my ML-Portfolio, this is the first one I tackled.

From a cursory look at datasets available from Kaggle, this one was the least processed, having not been previously manipulated with principal component analysis for each feature beforehand.

The dataset is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/shubhamjoshi2130of/abstract-data-set-for-credit-card-fraud-detection

Upon seeing that fraud cases were already by a boolean target variable, I immediately thought to use a logistic regression.

The Data's features were already well engineered, so aside from changing 'Y/N' to '1/0' for boolean values, I had to do very little to prep this dataset for analysis.

For hyperparameter tuning, I realized that the default l2 regularization was too punishing on outlying values, and opted instead for a more forgiving l1. This immediately boosted the predictive accuracy of this model from ~87% to 99%.

I am very pleased with the outcome of this model, especially considering I only put in approximately 2 hours of work on it.
